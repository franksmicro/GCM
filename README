This is my attempt at a "toy" global climate model.  It is still far from 
complete.  Feel free to use it however you want, but be warned this is still 
"alpha" quality code as of October, 2011.  I will not be liable for any 
mental or other harm that may come to you from looking at or using this code.

Presently, the following software libraries must be installed to compile:
- NETCDF dev
- FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) V3 (not presently being called)
